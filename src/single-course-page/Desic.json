Read through some of these reviews and see what other students are saying:</p><p>&gt; Excellent teaching ability combined with deep understanding of the subject has produced one of the <strong>best online courses I've taken in decades</strong>. Fabulous work! Thank you! - Maria Iano</p><p>&gt; <strong>Really amazing course</strong>. would recommend to all the students or programmers who want to learn python from scratch. - Hriday Panchal</p><p>&gt; Exactly the course I needed!!! Explanations are clear, lots of examples, and <strong>everything you need in python</strong>! thanks so much. - Julien Palleau</p><p>&gt; Another amazing offering from Jose. <strong>This course offers the most comprehensive look at Python available</strong>. Consider, for example, the extensive treatment regarding asynchronous development, or the detailed introduction to web development with Flask, or the Tkinter GUI introduction. I have had several other offerings by Jose here on Udemy. Always get far more than I expected. - Martin Dwyer</p><p>&gt; Honestly, I don’t know much about other courses, but after taking a quick peek at some of them, I can safely say that <strong>this is the most complete Python course in Udemy</strong>. [...] Definitely recommended for those who want to begin their Python journey but don’t know where to start. - Mateo Delgadillo Karam</p><p><br></p><p>Also remember: we have a <strong>30-day money-back guarantee</strong>, so sign up and try the course <strong>totally risk-free</strong>!</p><p>I'll see you on the inside.</p></div>",
